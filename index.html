          On Nov. 14 2024 I attended the World Usability Day Design Jam hosted
          by Calgary UX at Mount Royal University. It was an awesome night where
          we had an hour to quickly devise and wireframe a product that fits the
          theme of World Usability Day 2024!
        </p>
        <p>
          My group ended up winning first place based on our wireframes, ending
          the event with some prizes and a great experience :]
        </p>
        <br />
        <img

        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1><span style="background-color: red">02 Concept</span></h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          The theme of World Usability Day 2024 was ensuring that all voices,
          especially those from underrepresented groups, are included in and can
          meaningfully participate in civic discussions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/newyyc/wireframes.png" alt="wireframes" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Our group decided to wireframe an easy to use website that allows
          newcomers in Calgary to streamline their experience in finding events
          and resources near them to better integrate them into what's happening
          in the city.
          <br />
          <br />
          I honestly ended up feeling really confident about our product, even
          moreso after winning that I decided to use my weekend after to
          actually build the project into fruition.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1><span style="background-color: red">03 Designing</span></h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          Using our already fantastic wireframes, I had a super easy time
          designing it in Figma.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/newyyc/figma.png" alt="Figma" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          I decided to name the project NewYYC, one because it's clear and
          concise about what the website entails, and another is because I had a
          really neat idea for the logo, wrapping YYC around itself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/newyyc/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          A disproportionate amount of my time was spent designing a map of
          Calgary dividing its quadrants, it felt like a great experience for me
          trying different approaches on the design and implementing it in code.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/newyyc/map.png" alt="Map" />

        <h1><span style="background-color: red">04 Coding</span></h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          With everything designed in Figma, the final step was building the
          actual app. I ended up using Vercel to build and deploy the project,
          using the standard React Framework.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since I was pressed on time as I constrained myself for the project's
          start and finish to be within the weekend, I ended up trying and using
          Cursor for the first time to get the project built as fast as I can.
          It ended up being really intuitive to use and gave me a strong
          foundation to work off of in order to get the look and feel of the
          website just how I wanted it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/newyyc/cursor.png" alt="Cursor" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          For the website's results, I ended up using the City of Calgary's
          official data and API to obtain their recreational events.
        </p>

        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          The final build of the project ended up looking amazing, and worked
          seamlessly. I ended up learning a lot about working on a time
          constraint, both from the design jam and the weekend project!

          I love listening to music. I enjoy hearing beautiful melodies,
          exquisite sound design, and out-of-the-box production techniques that
          make music interesting.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, I find that I don't always pay attention to the lyrics.
          Whenever I listen to music with friends, I often find that they would
          be quick to point out a lyric in a song that may stand out, whether it
          be good or bad.
          <br />
          <br />
          My response to this would usually be me not even realizing it was in
          the song in the first place! 🤷‍♂️ Because of this, I decided to analyze
          my Spotify stats to see if it actually reflects my tendency to not
          care about lyrics.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>
          <span style="background-color: lime"

        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          I used the Spotify API to access my listening history. After signing
          up for an API key at the
          <a href="https://beta.developer.spotify.com/"
            >Spotify for Developers</a
          >
          page, I was able to use
          <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">Spotipy</a> to access my
          top artists, top tracks, and metadata for each song.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/lyrics/spotipy.png" alt="spotipy" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Top tracks are stored in three separate ranges, short-term (4 weeks),
          medium-term (6 months), and long-term (all-time).
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/lyrics/csv.png" alt="csv" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          I decided to store all of this data in a .csv file so that my main
          comparison for data analysis would be between the time ranges.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/lyrics/toptracks.png" alt="toptracks" />

          >
        </h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          Now that I have all of my top tracks, I need to fetch the lyrics of
          each song. I decided to use
          <a href="https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/"
            >LyricsGenius</a
          >
          for this, as I can easily match the metadata from the .csv file to
          quickly obtain all of the lyrics.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/lyrics/json.png" alt="json" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Just like Spotipy, all I needed to do was sign up for an API key. From
          there, I was able to save all of the lyrics in a .json file.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/lyrics/metadata.png" alt="metadata" />

        <h1>
          <span style="background-color: lime">04 Lyric Analysis</span>
        </h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          Scraping Spotify and Genius was the easy part; now comes the lyric
          analysis. My main three metrics to decipher if I care about lyrics or
          not were:
          <br />
          <br />
          Q01: How much of what I listen to is just repeated / barebones lyrics?
          (Line Repetition)
          <br />
          Q02: How much of what I listen to contains complex verses? (Verse
          complexity)
          <br />
          Q03: How much of what I listen to contains unique words? (Word
          diversity)
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/lyrics/metrics.png" alt="metrics" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          A01: Lyric repetition was calculated by splitting the lyrics into
          lines and simply counting if the lines were repeating.
          <br />A02: Complex verses were analyzed in each song by counting how
          many unique verses exist. <br />A03: Unique words were calculated by
          finding the ratio of how many times a word appears and comparing it to
          the all of the words.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>
          <span style="background-color: lime">05 Data Visualisation</span>
        </h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          Now that the lyrics were analyzed, it's time to visualise the data. I
          mainly used Matplotlib to visualise the data, opting to maximise
          readability by creating bar charts for each listening range. I even
          decided to display metric interpretations depending on how each range
          compares to each other.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="../img/lyrics/interpret.png" alt="interpret" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1>
          <span style="background-color: lime">06 Analysis Results</span>
        </h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          With everything setup, it was finally time to display the data! All I
          had to do was run my python program to analyze the lyrics. The output
          was three graphs generated by Matplotlib, and the results ended up
          surprising me...
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="../img/lyrics/results.png" alt="results" /> <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Comparing my overall top tracks with my recent top tracks, I can see
          that my overall listening habits have gravitated towards my
          subconscious caring for lyrics. I've been listening to less repetitive
          and more complex songs, albeit with a lot less vocabulary diversity,
          which is what surprised me most.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was a fun way for me to combine my passion of music along
          with coding and data visualisation in order to try and find
          introspective answers to how my listening to music has changed over
          time.
          <br />
          <br />
          I learned a lot about using different API's in conjunction with each
          other along with file creation between them. Furthermore, I learned
          even more about how to analyse and visualise data to align it with my
          own criteria and present it in a way that is easy to understand
          <br />
          <br />
          Moving forward, I'd like to try and refine my methods of analysing
          data in comparison with a set criteria. I'd also like to explore more
          ways in improving how I can visualise data, specifically with more
          eye-catching models and interactivity.

        <p>
          For my 2023 Capstone Project, my group worked closely with the
          Canadian Alliance for Intergenerational Living to create an essential
          task tracker web app so that the organization can monitor student
          progress.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1><span style="background-color: aqua">02 Problem</span></h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          The organization allows affordable housing to students in exchange for
          spending time with seniors. In order to accurately log these tasks,
          they needed an app that can be used by both the organization and
          students.
        </p>

        <h1><span style="background-color: aqua">03 Solution</span></h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          A lightweight, flexible web app that enables students to easily create
          tasks and log their monthly progress, in addition to allowing admins
          to easily manage and track student data at a glance.

        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          We met with Silvera, the company working with CAIL to house and work
          directly with the students, in order to acquire all of their
          requirements for what our web app should provide. In general, Silvera
          wanted the app to be as hands off as possible with an emphasis on ease
          of use and accessibility.
          <br />
          <br />
          Students should be using the app solely to mark what tasks they have
          done and to track what they need to do, and both CAIL and Silvera will
          only use the app to collect the task data and lightly manage users.

        <p>
          We divided our requirements based on use case and view, with the app
          being split on Student Use Case and Admin Use Case:
          <br /><br />
          Student: <br />
          01 Task Creation, Management and Tracking <br />
          02 Calendar Functionality <br />
          03 Hour tracking <br />
          <br />
          Admin: <br />
          01 Creation and Management of Student Information <br />
          02 Data Retrieval for Reporting <br />
          03 Banked Hours Tracking <br />

        </h1>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>
          Upon contact with CAIL we established client check-ins every 2 weeks,
          with most of testing done internally until March where we had our
          clients test the app as both student and admin.
          <br />
          <br />
          The continuous client check-ins helped us stay focused on what needs
          to be done on a bi-weekly basis. Client testing was integral in
          allowing us to add in additional tweaks and changes that greatly
          improved the app for student and admin use.

        <p>
          By the end of the semester we were able to successfully integrate all
          requirements and evaluations to create the desired webapp for the
          client. The tools used to create the webapp included Figma for the
          UI/UX and wireframing, MongoDB to handle the backend, and a frontend
          tech stack including Vercel, React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS.

          Upon the completion and presentation of this Capstone Project, CAIL
          notified us that they would be integrating the app within the
          organization by the end of the summer. It would be launched as the
          students start their Fall Semester, with additional student testing
          done beforehand.
          <br />
          <br />
          Short term goals for the webapp that would be completed before full
          launch will include:
          <br />
          <br />
          01 Transfer of deployment and build of app across platforms if needed
          <br />
          02 Accessibility improvements such as localization and screen reader
          optimization
          <br />
          03 Outlook integration, allowing for email notifications
