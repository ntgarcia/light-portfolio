        Data Analysis: Do I Care About Lyrics?

      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      <br />
      I love listening to music. I enjoy hearing beautiful melodies, exquisite
      sound design, and overall out-of-the-box production techniques that push
      the boundaries outward.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, I find that I don't always pay attention to the lyrics. Whenever
      I listen to music with friends, I often find that they would be quick to
      point out a lyric in a song that may stand out, whether it be good or bad.
      <br />
      <br />
      My response to this would usually be me not even realizing it was in the
      song in the first place! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Because of this, I decided to analyze my
      Spotify stats to see if it actually reflects my tendency to not care about
      lyrics.
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h1>FETCHING TOP TRACKS FROM SPOTIFY</h1>
      <br />
      I used the Spotify API to access my listening history. After signing up
      for an API key at the
      <a href="https://beta.developer.spotify.com/">Spotify for Developers</a>
      page, I was able to use
      <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">Spotipy</a> to access my top
      artists, top tracks, and metadata for each song.
      <br />
      <img src="../img/lyrics/spotipy.png" alt="Spotipy" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Top tracks are stored in three separate ranges, short-term (4 weeks),
      medium-term (6 months), and long-term (all-time).
      <br />
      <img src="../img/lyrics/csv.png" alt="csv" />
      <br />
      <br />
      I decided to store all of this data in a .csv file so that my main
      comparison for data analysis would be between the time ranges.
      <br />

    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h1>FETCHING LYRICS FROM GENIUS</h1>
      <br />
      Now that I have all of my top tracks, I need to fetch the lyrics of each
      song. I decided to use
      <a href="https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/">LyricsGenius</a>
      for this, as I can easily match the metadata from the .csv file to quickly
      obtain all of the lyrics.
      <br />
      <img src="../img/lyrics/json.png" alt="json" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Just like Spotipy, all I needed to do was sign up for an API key. From
      there, I was able to save all of the lyrics in a .json file.

      <h1>LYRIC ANALYSIS</h1>
      <br />
      Scraping Spotify and Genius was the easy part; now comes the lyric
      analysis. My main three metrics to decipher if I care about lyrics or not
      were:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Q1: How much of what I listen to is just repeated / barebones lyrics?
          (Line Repetition)
        </li>
        <li>
          Q2: How much of what I listen to contains complex verses? (Verse
          complexity)
        </li>
        <li>
          Q3: How much of what I listen to contains unique words? (Word
          diversity)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../img/lyrics/metrics.png" alt="metrics" />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          A1: Lyric repetition was calculated by splitting the lyrics into lines
          and simply counting if the lines were repeating.
        </li>
        <li>
          A2: Complex verses were analyzed in each song by counting how many
          unique verses exist.
        </li>
        <li>
          A3: Unique words were calculated by finding the ratio of how many
          times a word appears and comparing it to the all of the words.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h1>DATA VISUALISATION</h1>
      <br />
      Now that the lyrics were analyzed, it's time to visualise the data. I
      mainly used
      <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> to visualise the data,
      opting to maximise readability by creating bar charts for each listening
      range. I even decided to display metric interpretations depending on how
      each range compares to each other.
      <img src="../img/lyrics/interpret.png" alt="interpret" />
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h1>ANALYSIS RESULTS</h1>
      <br />
      With everything setup, it was finally time to display the data! All I had
      to do was run my python program to analyze the lyrics. The output was
      three graphs generated by Matplotlib, and the results ended up surprising
      me...
      <br />
      <img src="../img/lyrics/results.png" alt="results" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Comparing my overall top tracks with my recent top tracks, I can see that
      my overall listening habits have gravitated towards my subconscious caring
      for lyrics. I've been listening to less repetitive and more complex songs,
      albeit with a lot less vocabulary diversity, which is what surprised me
      most.

      <h1>EXPERIENCE AND FINDINGS</h1>
      <br />
      This project was a fun way for me to combine my passion of music along
      with coding and data visualisation in order to try and find introspective
      answers to how my listening to music has changed over time.
      <br />
      <br />
      I learned a lot about using different API's in conjunction with each other
      along with file creation between them. Furthermore, I learned even more
      about how to analyse and visualise data to align it with my own criteria
      and present it in a way that is easy to understand
      <br />
      <br />
      Moving forward, I'd like to try and refine my methods of analysing data in
      comparison with a set criteria. I'd also like to explore more ways in
      improving how I can visualise data, specifically with more eye-catching
      models and interactivity.
