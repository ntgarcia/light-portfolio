      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">01 </span>Intro
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Nov. 14 2024 I attended the
      <a href="https://librarycal.mtroyal.ca/event/3839957" target="_blank">World Usability Day Design Jam hosted by
        Calgary UX at Mount Royal
        University.</a>
      It was an awesome night where we had an hour to quickly devise and
      wireframe a product that fits the theme of World Usability Day 2024!
      <br />
      <br />
      My group ended up winning first place based on our wireframes, ending
      the event with some prizes and a great experience!

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">02 </span>Concept
    </h2>
    <p>
      The theme of World Usability Day 2024 was ensuring that all voices,
      especially those from underrepresented groups, are included in and can
      meaningfully participate in civic discussions.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/newyyc/wireframes.png" alt="wireframes" />
    <p>
      Our group decided to wireframe an easy to use website that allows
      newcomers in Calgary to streamline their experience in finding events
      and resources near them to better integrate them into what's happening
      in the city.
      <br />
      <br />
      I honestly ended up feeling really confident about our product, even
      moreso after winning that I decided to use my weekend after to actually
      build the project into fruition.

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">03 </span>Designing
    </h2>
    <p>
      Using our already fantastic wireframes, I had a super easy time
      designing it in Figma.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/newyyc/figma.png" alt="Figma" />
    <p>
      I decided to name the project NewYYC, one because it's clear and concise
      about what the website entails, and another is because I had a really
      neat idea for the logo, wrapping YYC around itself.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/newyyc/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
    <p>
      A disproportionate amount of my time was spent designing a map of
      Calgary dividing its quadrants, it felt like a great experience for me
      trying different approaches on the design and implementing it in code.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">04 </span>Coding
    </h2>
    <p>
      With everything designed in Figma, the final step was building the
      actual app. I ended up using Vercel to build and deploy the project,
      using the standard React Framework.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since I was pressed on time as I constrained myself for the project's
      start and finish to be within the weekend, I ended up trying and using
      Cursor for the first time to get the project built as fast as I can.
      <br />
      <br />
      It ended up being really intuitive to use and gave me a strong
      foundation to work off of in order to get the look and feel of the
      website just how I wanted it.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/newyyc/cursor.png" alt="Cursor" />
    <p>
      For the website's results, I ended up using
      <a href="https://data.calgary.ca/Recreation-and-Culture/Recreation-Program-Listings/q9hh-gfbx/about_data">the City
        of Calgary's official data and API</a>
      to obtain their recreational events.

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">05 </span>Final Outcome
    </h2>
    <p>
      The final build of the project ended up looking amazing, and worked
      seamlessly. I ended up learning a lot about working on a time
      constraint, both from the design jam and the weekend project! The
      website can be viewed
