      <h1><span>01 Intro</span></h1>
      <p>
        On Nov. 14 2024 I attended the
        <a href="https://librarycal.mtroyal.ca/event/3839957" target="_blank"
          >World Usability Day Design Jam hosted by Calgary UX at Mount Royal
          University.</a
        >
        It was an awesome night where we had an hour to quickly devise and
        wireframe a product that fits the theme of World Usability Day 2024!
        <br />
        <br />
        My group ended up winning first place based on our wireframes, ending
        the event with some prizes and a great experience!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/img/newyyc/winners.png"
        alt="winners"
        style="aspect-ratio: 3/2"
      />
      <br />
      <h1><span>02 Concept</span></h1>
      <p>
        The theme of World Usability Day 2024 was ensuring that all voices,
        especially those from underrepresented groups, are included in and can
        meaningfully participate in civic discussions.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/newyyc/wireframes.png" alt="wireframes" />
      <p>
        Our group decided to wireframe an easy to use website that allows
        newcomers in Calgary to streamline their experience in finding events
        and resources near them to better integrate them into what's happening
        in the city.
        <br />
        <br />
        I honestly ended up feeling really confident about our product, even
        moreso after winning that I decided to use my weekend after to actually
        build the project into fruition.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1><span>03 Designing</span></h1>
      <p>
        Using our already fantastic wireframes, I had a super easy time
        designing it in Figma.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/newyyc/figma.png" alt="Figma" />
      <p>
        I decided to name the project NewYYC, one because it's clear and concise
        about what the website entails, and another is because I had a really
        neat idea for the logo, wrapping YYC around itself.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/newyyc/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
      <p>
        A disproportionate amount of my time was spent designing a map of
        Calgary dividing its quadrants, it felt like a great experience for me
        trying different approaches on the design and implementing it in code.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/newyyc/map.png" alt="Map" />
      <br />
      <h1><span>04 Coding</span></h1>
      <p>
        With everything designed in Figma, the final step was building the
        actual app. I ended up using Vercel to build and deploy the project,
        using the standard React Framework.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since I was pressed on time as I constrained myself for the project's
        start and finish to be within the weekend, I ended up trying and using
        Cursor for the first time to get the project built as fast as I can.
        <br />
        <br />
        It ended up being really intuitive to use and gave me a strong
        foundation to work off of in order to get the look and feel of the
        website just how I wanted it.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/newyyc/cursor.png" alt="Cursor" />
      <p>
        For the website's results, I ended up using
        <a
          href="https://data.calgary.ca/Recreation-and-Culture/Recreation-Program-Listings/q9hh-gfbx/about_data"
          >the City of Calgary's official data and API</a
        >
        to obtain their recreational events.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/newyyc/api.png" alt="API" />
      <br />
      <h1><span>05 Final Outcome</span></h1>
      <p>
        The final build of the project ended up looking amazing, and worked
        seamlessly. I ended up learning a lot about working on a time
        constraint, both from the design jam and the weekend project! The
        website can be viewed
