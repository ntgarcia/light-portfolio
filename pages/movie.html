      <h1>Movie Club</h1>
      <br />
      <h1>01 Intro</h1>
      <p>
        For a lighthearted New Year's Resolution, I along with some of my
        friends decided to do a monthly movie club. From rotating between who
        picks what movie to watch, we would view it individually on our own time
        and then discuss our thoughts on the movie at the end of the month.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/movie/cover.png" alt="movie" />
      <h1>02 Process</h1>
      <p>
        With the website being a simple static page solely for displaying the
        movie information and our thoughts, I decided to use a standard
        Vercel-based stack. Built and deployed on Vercel, coded with NextJS,
        Tailwind, and utilized shadcn components.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>03 Final Outcome</h1>
      <p>
        The website can be viewed
        <a href="https://www.creamcheese.club/" target="_blank">here</a>. Movies
        will (hopefully) be added monthly, not just from the movie club but
        hopefully extended towards actual group viewings whether it be at get
        togethers or in the theater.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently all movie info and individual comments are added manually. In
        the future I plan on implementing automatic movie info addition from an
        external API, along with the ability for individual users to post their
        own comments.
