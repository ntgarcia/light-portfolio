      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">01 </span>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        For my 2023 Capstone Project, my group worked closely with the Canadian
        Alliance for Intergenerational Living to create an essential task
        tracker web app so that the organization can monitor student progress.
      </p>

      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">02 </span>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The organization allows affordable housing to students in exchange for
        spending time with seniors. In order to accurately log these tasks, they
        needed an app that can be used by both the organization and students.
      </p>

      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">03 </span>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        A lightweight, flexible web app that enables students to easily create
        tasks and log their monthly progress, in addition to allowing admins to
        easily manage and track student data at a glance.

      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">04 </span>Research Methods</h2>
      <p>
        We met with Silvera, the company working with CAIL to house and work
        directly with the students, in order to acquire all of their
        requirements for what our web app should provide. In general, Silvera
        wanted the app to be as hands off as possible with an emphasis on ease
        of use and accessibility. Students should be using the app solely to
        mark what tasks they have done and to track what they need to do, and
        both CAIL and Silvera will only use the app to collect the task data and
        lightly manage users.

      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">05 </span>High Level Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        We divided our requirements based on use case and view, with the app
        being split on Student Use Case and Admin Use Case:
        <br /><br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">Student:</span> <br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">01.</span> Task Creation, Management and
        Tracking <br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">02.</span> Calendar Functionality <br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">03.</span> Hour tracking <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">Admin:</span> <br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">01.</span> Creation and Management of
        Student Information <br />

      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">06 </span>Evaluation & Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Upon contact with CAIL we established client check-ins every 2 weeks,
        with most of testing done internally until March where we had our
        clients test the app as both student and admin. The continuous client
        check-ins helped us stay focused on what needs to be done on a bi-weekly
        basis. Client testing was integral in allowing us to add in additional
        tweaks and changes that greatly improved the app for student and admin
        use.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">07 </span>Final Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        By the end of the semester we were able to successfully integrate all
        requirements and evaluations to create the desired webapp for the
        client. The tools used to create the webapp included Figma for the UI/UX
        and wireframing, MongoDB to handle the backend, and a frontend tech
        stack including Vercel, React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS.

      <h2><span style="color: #9d9d9d">08 </span>Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        Upon the completion and presentation of this Capstone Project, CAIL
        notified us that they would be integrating the app within the
        organization by the end of the summer. It would be launched as the
        students start their Fall Semester, with additional student testing done
        beforehand. Short term goals for the webapp that would be completed
        before full launch will include:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">01.</span> Transfer of deployment and build
        of app across platforms if needed
        <br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">02.</span> Accessibility improvements such
        as localization and screen reader optimization
        <br />
        <span style="color: #f0f0f0">03.</span> Outlook integration, allowing
        for email notifications
