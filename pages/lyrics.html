    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">01 </span>Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      I love listening to music. I enjoy hearing beautiful melodies, exquisite
      sound design, and out-of-the-box production techniques that make music
      interesting.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, I find that I don't always pay attention to the lyrics.
      Whenever I listen to music with friends, I often find that they would be
      quick to point out a lyric in a song that may stand out, whether it be
      good or bad.
      <br />
      <br />
      My response to this would usually be me not even realizing it was in the
      song in the first place! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Because of this, I decided to analyze my
      Spotify stats to see if it actually reflects my tendency to not care
      about lyrics.

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">02 </span>Fetching Top Tracks from Spotify
    </h2>
    <p>
      I used the Spotify API to access my listening history. After signing up
      for an API key at the
      <a href="https://beta.developer.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify for Developers</a>
      page, I was able to use
      <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy" target="_blank">Spotipy</a>
      to access my top artists, top tracks, and metadata for each song.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/lyrics/spotipy.png" alt="spotipy" />
    <p>
      Top tracks are stored in three separate ranges, short-term (4 weeks),
      medium-term (6 months), and long-term (all-time).
    </p>
    <img src="/img/lyrics/csv.png" alt="csv" />
    <p>
      I decided to store all of this data in a .csv file so that my main
      comparison for data analysis would be between the time ranges.

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">03 </span>Fetching Lyrics from Genius
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that I have all of my top tracks, I need to fetch the lyrics of each
      song. I decided to use
      <a href="https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank">LyricsGenius</a>
      for this, as I can easily match the metadata from the .csv file to
      quickly obtain all of the lyrics.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/lyrics/json.png" alt="json" />
    <p>
      Just like Spotipy, all I needed to do was sign up for an API key. From
      there, I was able to save all of the lyrics in a .json file.

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">04 </span>Lyrical Analysis
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scraping Spotify and Genius was the easy part; now comes the lyric
      analysis. My main three metrics to decipher if I care about lyrics or
      not were:
      <br>
      <br />
      <span style="color: #f0f0f0;">Q01:</span> How much of what I listen to is just repeated / barebones
      lyrics? (Line Repetition)
      <br />
      <span style="color: #f0f0f0;">Q02:</span> How much of what I listen to
      contains complex verses? (Verse complexity)
      <br />
      <span style="color: #f0f0f0;">Q03:</span> How much of what
      I listen to contains unique words? (Word diversity)
    </p>
    <img src="/img/lyrics/metrics.png" alt="metrics" />
    <p>
      <span style="color: #f0f0f0;">A01:</span> Lyric repetition was calculated by splitting the lyrics into lines
      and simply counting if the lines were repeating.
      <br />
      <span style="color: #f0f0f0;">A02:</span> Complex verses were analyzed in each song by counting how many
      unique verses exist. <br /><span style="color: #f0f0f0;">A03:</span> Unique words were calculated by finding
      the ratio of how many times a word appears and comparing it to the all
      of the words.

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">05 </span>Data Visualisation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that the lyrics were analyzed, it's time to visualise the data. I
      mainly used Matplotlib to visualise the data, opting to maximise
      readability by creating bar charts for each listening range. I even
      decided to display metric interpretations depending on how each range
      compares to each other.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/lyrics/interpret.png" alt="interpret" />
    <hr>
    <br />
    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">06 </span>Analysis Results
    </h2>
    <p>
      With everything setup, it was finally time to display the data! All I
      had to do was run my python program to analyze the lyrics. The output
      was three graphs generated by Matplotlib, and the results ended up
      surprising me...
    </p>
    <img src="/img/lyrics/results.png" alt="results" />
    <p>
      Comparing my overall top tracks with my recent top tracks, I can see
      that my overall listening habits have gravitated towards my subconscious
      caring for lyrics. I've been listening to less repetitive and more
      complex songs, albeit with a lot less vocabulary diversity, which is
      what surprised me most.

    <h2>
      <span style="  color: #9d9d9d;">07 </span>Experience & Findings
    </h2>
    <p>
      This project was a fun way for me to combine my passion of music along
      with coding and data visualisation in order to try and find
      introspective answers to how my listening to music has changed over
      time. I learned a lot about using different API's in conjunction with
      each other along with file creation between them. Furthermore, I learned
      even more about how to analyse and visualise data to align it with my
      own criteria and present it in a way that is easy to understand Moving
      forward, I'd like to try and refine my methods of analysing data in
      comparison with a set criteria. I'd also like to explore more ways in
      improving how I can visualise data, specifically with more eye-catching
      models and interactivity.
