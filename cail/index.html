    <h2>INTRO</h2>
    <p>
      For my capstone project, my group worked closely with the Canadian
      Alliance for Intergenerational Living to create an essential task tracker
      web app so that the organization can monitor student progress.

        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          The organization allows affordable housing to students in exchange for
          spending time with seniors. In order to accurately log these tasks,
          they needed an app that can be used by both the organization and
          students.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          A lightweight, flexible web app that enables students to easily create
          tasks and log their monthly progress, in addition to allowing admins
          to easily manage and track student data at a glance.

    <h2>RESEARCH METHODS</h2>
    <p>
      We met with Silvera, the company working with CAIL to house and work
      directly with the students, in order to acquire all of their requirements
      for what our web app should provide. In general, Silvera wanted the app to
      be as hands off as possible with an emphasis on ease of use and
      accessibility. <br /><br />
      Students should be using the app solely to mark what tasks they have done
      and to track what they need to do, and both CAIL and Silvera will only use
      the app to collect the task data and lightly manage users.

    <h2>HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS</h2>
    <p>
      We divided our requirements based on use case and view, with the app being
      split on Student Use Case and Admin Use Case:
    </p>
    <div class="atm">
      <div>
        Student:
        <ul>
          <li>Task Creation, Management and Tracking</li>
          <li>Calendar Functionality</li>
          <li>Hour tracking</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        Admin:
        <ul>
          <li>Creation and Management of Student Information</li>
          <li>Data Retrieval for Reporting</li>
          <li>Banked Hours Tracking</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <br />

    <h2>EVALUATION AND TESTING</h2>
    <p>
      Upon contact with CAIL we established client check-ins every 2 weeks, with
      most of testing done internally until March where we had our clients test
      the app as both student and admin. <br /><br />
      The continuous client check-ins helped us stay focused on what needs to be
      done on a bi-weekly basis. Client testing was integral in allowing us to
      add in additional tweaks and changes that greatly improved the app for
      student and admin use.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>FINAL OUTCOME</h2>
    <p>By the end of the semester we were able to successfully integrate all requirements
      and evaluations to create the desired webapp for the client. The tools used to create
      the webapp included Figma for the UI/UX and wireframing, MongoDB to handle the backend,
      and a frontend tech stack including Vercel, React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS.</p>

    <h2>FUTURE WORK</h2>
    <p>
      Upon the completion and presentation of this Capstone Project, CAIL
      notified us that they would be integrating the app within the organization
      by the end of the summer. It would be launched as the students start their
      Fall Semester, with additional student testing done beforehand.
      <br />
      <br />
      Short term goals for the webapp that would be completed before full launch will include:
        <ul>
          <li>Transfer of deployment and build of app across platforms if needed</li>
          <li>Accessibility improvements such as localization and screen reader optimization</li>
          <li>Outlook integration, allowing for email notifications</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
